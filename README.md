# Pipefy-PHP-SDK
(Mostly autogenerated) PHP Code to access Pipefy's API

The code for the generation can be found in `./bin/generateSDK.sh`.
It is run periodically by a GitHub Action to update the SDK in case the specification changed.

## Contributing

Contributions are highly welcome.
Make sure to keep your contribution general enough that it does not get overridden when running the generator again.
In other words, at the current point in time, *DO NOT MODIFY CODE IN `src`*.
