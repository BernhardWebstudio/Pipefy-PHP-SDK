# Pipefy-PHP-SDK
(Mostly autogenerated) PHP Code to access Pipefy's API

The code for the generation can be found in `./bin/generateSDK.sh`.
It is run periodically by a GitHub Action to update the SDK in case the specification changed.

## Usage

To (re)generate the SDK, run `./bin/generateSDK.sh`.
Note that this already imposes some requirements, e.g. bash, swagger-codegen, npx.

To use the SDK, well, I do not know yet. It appears the generator is not smart enough to be actually usable yet.
The reason is that the apiary docs by Pipefy are not as detailed as their website. So, first, another generator generating swagger from their website would have to be written.

## Contributing

Contributions are highly welcome.
Make sure to keep your contribution general enough that it does not get overridden when running the generator again.
In other words, at the current point in time, *DO NOT MODIFY CODE IN `src`*.
