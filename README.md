# Pipefy-PHP-SDK
(Mostly autogenerated) PHP Code to access Pipefy's API

## Usage

This code was intially generated using [`mghoneimy/php-graphql-oqm`](https://github.com/mghoneimy/php-graphql-oqm) and then adjusted to actually be usable (removal of duplicate and deprecated fields, rename of a few methods). 

Note that currently, only queries are supported. Refer to their issue [#16](https://github.com/mghoneimy/php-graphql-oqm/issues/16) to subscribe for updates on when mutations will be implemented.

It can be used together with [`mghoneimy/php-graphql-client`](https://github.com/mghoneimy/php-graphql-client) and can be used as described in the corresponding documentations.
